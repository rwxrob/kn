# ðŸ’¥ DEPRECATED: KEG Node Utility

***ðŸ’¥ DEPRECATED: This code and utility has been replace by [`keg`](https://github.com/rwxrob/keg). It is kept around for historical purposes and to ensure everything in it has been implemented in its replacement, which is a composable, stand-alone stateful command branch as opposed to a Perl script with obvious problematic dependencies.***
